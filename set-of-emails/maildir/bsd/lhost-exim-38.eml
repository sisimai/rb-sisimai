This message was created automatically by mail delivery software.
A message that you sent has not yet been delivered to one or more of its
recipients after more than 24 hours on the queue on neko.example.com.

The message identifier is:     neko222-nyaaan-22
The subject of the message is: Nyaan
The date of the message is:    Thu, 22 Apr 2016 23:34:45 +0900

The address to which the message has not yet been delivered is:

  kijitora@example.co.jp
    host mta-nyaan.example.co.jp [192.0.2.222]
    Delay reason: SMTP error from remote mail server after MAIL FROM:<sironeko-nyaan@neko.example.com> SIZE=1024:
    450 service permits 2 unverifyable sending IPs - neko.example.com is not 203.0.113.222

No action is required on your part. Delivery attempts will continue for
some time, and this warning may be repeated at intervals if the message
remains undelivered. Eventually the mail delivery software will give up,
and when that happens, the message will be returned to you.
